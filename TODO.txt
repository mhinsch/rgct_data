data model
----------

* which parameters to fit?

* which data, how to use?
	* arrivals			delta over time			fit model against
	* mortality 		% relative to arrivals	use directly
	* interceptions		% relative to arrivals	fit model against
	* presence			delta over time			fit model against
	* frontex			use * factor => interc	fit factor (see parameters)
	* NGOs				use * factor => arrival	fit factor (see parameters)

* summary statistics
	* what to compare?
	* implement

* risk scenario
	* parameter p_i
	* parameter handling

* interceptions?
	* TODO? currently death rate is ignored for this
	* just increase friction?
		* how do we fit interceptions then?
		* what about people who change their mind after interception?
		
		expected number of tries before success
		n = 1/(1-p_i)

		expected number of interceptions
		n_i = n-1 = 1/(1-p_i) - 1

	* add to output 


		

* waiting?
	* should waiting be included?
	* if so, how?

* return/abort?
	* not for now, I think

* resources/quality?
	set all equal for now

* add Western Med


info
----

* different trust levels dependent on source
* broadcast info on risk


* rename friction in info/location (keeps confusing me)

* motivated false info (?)

* forget contacts
	- by success (remaining capital)

* communicate routes

* info exchange by interestingness/relevance?
	- more capital => higher authority?
